The second leg remained scoreless until the 82nd minute when Nicaragua’s Juan Barrera converted a penalty kick for his first of three goals in a span of six minutes, twice inspiring a bench-clearing celebration and frenzy amongst the home crowd in La Azul y Blanco’s Gold Cup-clinching victory. \n\nAs announced by CONCACAF on March 7, the U.S. begins tournament play Saturday, July 8 against Panama at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn. The MNT earned a 1-1 draw away to Panama in the Final Round of World Cup Qualifying last night and boasts a 5-1-3 all-time advantage against Los Canaleros in the Gold Cup. The MNT’s lone Gold Cup Group Stage loss came to Panama in 2011 in a 2-1 defeat.\n\nThe USA then heads to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. on Wednesday, July 12 for a matchup with Martinique. The island nation, an overseas department of France that is not recognized as a FIFA member, earned its berth by advancing to the semifinals of the 2017 Caribbean Cup. Brian McBride notched a brace in the MNT’s lone meeting with Martinique at Gillette Stadium in the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nThe U.S. and Nicaragua will meet for the first time when they round out the Group Stage at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio on Saturday, July 18.",

Crafting “anthems for introverts,” Iraheta digs deep into dark places and transforms this anguish into lush, unforgettable melodies. Halo Circus’ debut earned instant acclaim, with LA Magazine declaring, \"Allison Iraheta has moved beyond reality TV, forming a group that Duran Duran bassist John Taylor called ‘the best live band in the U.S.A.’ Think: dark, anthemic rock with a knack for soaring hooks.\" Ireheta was named Best Female Musician of 2016 by the LA Music Critics.\n\nHalo Circus quickly earned a reputation for their impressive live performances, which led to a series of high profile bookings, including: The Grammys \"Women Who Rock Festival At Sea\" with Heart, Emmylou Harris, and other iconic female singers; a four week Friday night residency at the prestigious Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles; and \"Say It Loud! A Night of Cultural Disruption\" at the legendary Troubadour. The band fully crowdsourced their entire 30-city \"Follow the Rabbit US Summer Tour\", their song “Band-Aid” was named “Song of the Year” by Popdust and their debut album “Bunny” was\nnamed a “Top Album of 2016” by AXS, Popdust and many more music publications.\n\n---\n\nRuby Rose Fox, a vocal powerhouse of soul-­driven, edgy rock ‘n’ roll, whose voice threatens to knock down the walls of any room in which she performs (alone or with her 8-piece band). Ruby Rose Fox was both the Improper Bostonian magazine’s pick for Best Musician of 2015 in the “Boston’s Best” issue, and featured on the cover of its 2015 “ Music” issue. Ruby also took home the “ Best Pop Artist,” “ Best Female Vocalist,” and “Best Songwriter” at the 2015/16 Boston Music Awards, and was named “ Female Performer of the Year,” by the 2016 New England Music Awards. \n\nThe Boston Herald describes Ruby Rose Fox’s music as “ arty, edgy rock ‘n’ roll that lets her be Lou Reed and Nico at the same time… [and seems] to come from another scene, another world.” Her debut album, “Domestic” was be released in 2016 charted to #8 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. Ruby received a 2017 Boston Foundation grant to make her sophomore album and will be spending much of the year touring the US.",

Or it’s just a really great rock record, it depends on how weird you’re willing to get..  But you’ve never had so much fun being crushed in the cogs of the universe’s great machine, that much is for sure!  I mean, there’s no law against having a couple cold beers while we all burn in the fire of time, am I right?!\n \nRecorded by Dave Curran of UNSANE/PIGS/BIG BUSINESS’ LAST RECORD fame.\n \nFounded in 2003 in Seattle, WA., Big Business has spent the last 13 years touring the world and making records.  In 2006 Jared and Coady joined forces with the Melvins and moved to Los Angeles.  Performing as members of the Melvins and staying autonomous as their own band, they have been there ever since.",

The second leg remained scoreless until the 82nd minute when Nicaragua’s Juan Barrera converted a penalty kick for his first of three goals in a span of six minutes, twice inspiring a bench-clearing celebration and frenzy amongst the home crowd in La Azul y Blanco’s Gold Cup-clinching victory. \n\nAs announced by CONCACAF on March 7, the U.S. begins tournament play Saturday, July 8 against Panama at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn. The MNT earned a 1-1 draw away to Panama in the Final Round of World Cup Qualifying last night and boasts a 5-1-3 all-time advantage against Los Canaleros in the Gold Cup. The MNT’s lone Gold Cup Group Stage loss came to Panama in 2011 in a 2-1 defeat.\n\nThe USA then heads to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. on Wednesday, July 12 for a matchup with Martinique. The island nation, an overseas department of France that is not recognized as a FIFA member, earned its berth by advancing to the semifinals of the 2017 Caribbean Cup. Brian McBride notched a brace in the MNT’s lone meeting with Martinique at Gillette Stadium in the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nThe U.S. and Nicaragua will meet for the first time when they round out the Group Stage at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio on Saturday, July 18.",

The band was formed from a non serious idea of C.J. Ridings and things just kept snowballing after a few songs were hosted online. Line ups shifted and members rotated until Spencer Ussery, Tommy Gonzalez, and Joe Sweat completed the roster that would end up penning a deal with Mascot Label Group. Big Jesus is a balancing act of heavy, pretty, bludgeoning, soothing, aggressive, and droning tones that are put together in a way that is distinctly their own.\n\nall ages welcome\n\nFACEBOOK EVENT: https://www.facebook.com/events/1397030553684462\n\nThe Red River Cultural District brings you the first annual Hot Summer Nights!

        "description": "Given the rising popularity of meditative, folky indie acts in the early 2000s, forming a twangy, rootsy folk trio was probably the least surprising move Derek Fudesco could have made. The former bassist and founding member of the successful indie rock group Pretty Girls Make Graves picked up an acoustic guitar and formed the Cave Singers following PGMG’s demise in January 2007, teaming up with vocalist Pete Quirk and drummer Marty Lund.\nThe Cave Singers released two albums on both Matador and Jagjaguwar Records. Following these releases, The Cave Singers began work on their fifth album. Rather than working with a record company, they opted to coordinate the project themselves and financed the recording through a crowdfunding campaign. The campaign raised 116 percent of the group’s goal, and the album, Banshee, was released in February 2016.",

        "title": "Rozwell Kid",
        "description": "Fronted by the affable, spectacled Jordan Hudkins, Rozwell Kid write massive, gritty, excitable power-punk songs; they channel Blue Album guitar grandiosity and eternally-hummable melodies conveyed in 'ooo''s, the likes of which would make Rivers Cuomo weak in his problematic knees. But when it came to writing Rozwell Kid’s new album, Precious Art, Jordan Hudkins found himself in the strange place of wondering who and what Rozwell Kid actually was. After more than two years on the road, the band – completed by guitarist Adam Meisterhans, bassist/vocalist Devin Donnelly and drummer Sean Hallock – hadn’t quite hit a dead end, but they needed to regroup, rethink and refind their identity.\nAll of those questions are thankfully answered by the twelve songs that make up Precious Art. It is a quintessential Rozwell Kid album and something entirely new at the same time. It’s teeming with understated nostalgia, but doesn’t get too lost in the past. Rather, it recalibrates the past, revisiting it with the added wisdom that comes with age. It’s quirky in the way that Rozwell Kid songs have always been quirky, but more than any other record the band has made, it sees Hudkins diving deep into the heart of human existence, telling universal truths based on his own personal memories and unexamined experiences.\n\nThis album also marks a new frontier in how the four members were able to write songs; having ample time in the studio allowed the band to be more experimental, and to collaborate in an entirely new way. But it’s remarkability is as much because of Hudkins’ insane ability to balance pathos and humor to turn the slightest, most oddball detail – whether that’s picking his nose, making Batman costumes or liking hummus – into works of, well, precious art. Not, of course, that that title is entirely sincere… \n\n“I think it’s hilarious for a rock’n’roll band to call anything they do Precious Art,” laughs Hudkins. “I think it’s really funny. But at the same time, these songs are my little babies – they’re my little precious art. That sounds so terrible! Maybe don’t put that in the bio!”",

        "title": "Unsane",
        "description": "New York City's Unsane assisted in pioneering a more aggressive, less studied version of noise rock, one that blended the scum/art industrial sturm und drang of Foetus, the Swans, Einsturzende Neubauten, and Sonic Youth with a decidedly more straightforward hardcore idiom. While developing the blueprint for noise bands to follow, Unsane cut a remarkable swath through underground music, inspiring a devoted, cult-like following around the globe. As a power trio, Unsane relied upon a hammering, power-press rhythm section, a searing Telecaster howl, and distorted vocals that resembled a chainsaw cutting a steel beam.\n\n Chris Spencer (vocals, guitar), Dave Curran (bass, vocals) and Vincent Signorelli (drums) are responsible for well over 2 decades of aural ruination, with no intention of letting up anytime soon. With a new full-length album in the bag, the band will be touring the globe starting summer 2017.",

(Which actually happened, of course.) They’ve even got casting suggestions if anyone wants to start filming—like Willem DeFoe, Winona Ryder, Lucy Liu, and Tommy Wiseau in as many roles as possible. Says guitarist Dakota Boettcher: “We all love movies so much. When you listen to a soundtrack, it has peaks and it has lows, but it’s a whole journey. That’s what we want to do. We want you to go on a journey.”",

        "title": "Meat Wave",
        "description": "with\nDasher\nRad Payoff\n\n\nWEBSITE: http://meatwavechicago.tumblr.com/\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MeatWaveChicago\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/meatwaveband\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw2jaoMNOAKv3Q4nDxwzsVQ\n\n--\nIn late 2014, Meat Waves 24-year-old frontman Chris Sutter found himself facing the end of the relationship he had been in since he was 12 years old. \"When youre in something like that for so long, it doesnt shield you from the world, but it softens your reality,\" he explains. \"A long relationship like that gives you confidence.\" He likens the experience of being single for the first time in his adult life to being an Amish kid on Rumspringa. \"I was just going nuts, making all the mistakes that you could make. It made for a really whack, fucked up time-very confused, always unsure-and that led to a bunch of shit,\" Sutter laughs grimly.\nThe Chicago punks had already made their second album Delusion Moon, a hardcore blast that castigated the weak excuses we ply for poor behaviour. That would come out in 2015. In the interim, Sutter started keeping a notebook to try and document the profound mood swings and torrents of anxiety that he was experiencing in the wake of the split, writing stream-of-consciousness poems about his feelings from day to day, city to city. One term kept coming out: The Incessant.\n\"I think that was the best way to describe this feeling-and I think a lot of people can attest to this-of this overwhelming, oncoming emotion,\" says Sutter. \"Feeling overwhelmed by the biggest thing going on in your life and the smallest fucking thing: theyre all oncoming, like dominos. Its a swelling. A pyramid. A crescendo. It stems from living recklessly. And selfishly. And regrettably. During this phase of my life, this feeling would come up a lot-out to dinner with my dad, in the van on tour-and I never used to have this kind of anxiety.\"\nPutting a name on it made Sutter feel a bit better. The Incessant became both the title and guiding light for Meat Waves third album, but not before some wobbles on Sutters part. Whereas Meat Waves previous albums had meted out judgements on the world, now he was writing brutally unvarnished lyrics about himself: about his self-indulgence, arrogance, fear of the future, isolation, and feeling totally at the whim of uncontrollable emotions. On tour for Delusion Moon, he began reflecting on the \"grey cloud\" he felt the material would cast over Meat Waves past and future. \"I got cold feet,\" he says. \"I had never written music that was this personal and confrontational with the self. I expressed to the others that I wanted to scrap the songs and start over, which they respected. I was uncomfortable to share songs with people that reflected on a destructive period in my life.\" But despite Sutters conviction, something in the back of his head told him he would be a fool to abandon the material.\n\"There was this realisation that I felt like the music I had written prior to this was more of a defence mechanism of sorts by not writing about what was going on in my life and not confronting myself, and instead looking outward at other people and what they were doing,\" he says. \"There are artists like Fiona Apple who I love and always look to-she bares herself and her soul and is so honest about her life, whats going on with her emotionally. I realised I could either write something that doesnt mean as much to me or I could write what means absolutely everything to me. I couldnt keep doing the same thing. I had to try and grow as a writer and musician.\"\nAnd thank god he did. The Incessant is a bracing, emotional punk record that confronts taking responsibility for your actions with dark humour and self-deprecation, drawing influence from acts like The Breeders, Hot Snakes, Drive Like Jehu, and, yes, Fiona Apple, as much as Franz Kafkas Metamorphosis, Jeffrey Eugenides Middlesex and the poems of Emily Dickinson and Sutters friend Hannah Gamble. On that literary tip, Sutter majored in journalism, and says his studies applied here more than ever. \"I had this amazing professor whose whole thing was-and its very simple, but it stuck with me-what were doing is trying to uncover the truth, or truths. I applied that exactly to what was going on with me, because I tended to run away from the truth or ignore it.\"\nHe cites the assaultive vocals and terse riffs of opener \"To Be Swayed\" as one of the truest realisations of that impulse. \"My only question going into that song was, why the hell am I so wishy-washy and so controlled by my very changing emotions? Trying to describe your true feelings is really difficult, really exhausting, but I feel like I really nailed what I was experiencing.\" That wave of changing emotions is evident across The Incessant: Sutter is self-lacerating on \"Mask\" (written in a 10-minute blast after seeing Thee Oh Sees live), the choppy \"Bad Man\", and the spiny, drawling \"Leopard Print Jet Ski\", whose ace title came from looking an old friend up on Facebook one day, to find him bragging about having bought precisely such a thing. \"I loved everything about the phrase,\" says Sutter. \"How it looked, the imagery. It stuck with me, and I viewed the leopard print jet ski as a metaphor for liberation and freedom and confidence. The song is this ironic first-person narrative of fucking taking the leopard print jet ski out and getting away from everything, in a very selfish, wrong way. Its a metaphor for how I was living my life, and much like a lot of other songs on the album, running away from my problems.\"\nElsewhere on The Incessant, Sutter exposes his most vulnerable side. Sounding like a less jubilant Japandroids track, \"Tomosaki\" is a nakedly sincere love song to the cat that he lost in the split, written while ugly-crying on the floor of the shared apartment he was about to leave behind. \"Entranced by the mist of life / Does he sense Ive gone awry? / My guy / Let him roam outside / Meditate on his afterlife,\" Sutter roars. \"That was huge for me as a songwriter. Ive never written a song like that. I think thats the power of something that touches you so deeply, like a cat that youre not going to be able to see any more.\" On the Ella Fitzgerald-inspired lament \"Birdland\" and rampaging snippet \"At The Lake\"-propelled by drummer Ryan Wizniaks stark charge-he reflects on a loss of innocence, and ultimately finds serenity.\nBassist Joe Gac produced Meat Waves previous records, but for The Incessant, the three-piece achieved their dream of working with legendary Chicago engineer Steve Albini, tracking and mixing the album in just four days. \"Between his music and the things hes done, bands hes recorded, hes the real deal,\" says Sutter. \"I dont know if Joe would admit this, but the way he works and records, hes like a student of Albini. It felt like the next step for us, and it was a good, quick, raw experience.\" Albinis famed dynamic range is best heard in \"Killing The Incessant\", the records epic, raging crescendo of a closing song. \"Incessant / Tried to see it / Ended eaten / Though now fear couldnt blanket me / No hand / Discriminates the other / Heres to killing / The Incessant / I dont need it / Heres to killing / The Incessant is defeated\", Sutter rails in stark, stabbing fragments. A tumult of noise churns, before giving way to a peaceful fingerpicked acoustic pattern.\n\"Towards the end of writing this album, I began to wonder exactly what The Incessant sounded like,\" says Sutter. \"Like, can I soundtrack that feeling? So thats how the crescendo came about. All that fucking tension. It was about shedding the ego. I think as humans we have more control than maybe we choose to believe sometimes. So this is trying to put it all at ease. Reject the fear and shame and the things that arent relative to my betterment and wellbeing. The acoustic ditty at the end is the sigh of relief. And a moving-forward of sorts.\"\nOf sorts. In July 2016, Sutter was due in Denver to be best man at his fathers wedding. The week prior to departing, he started feeling the same minor stomach pains that had plagued him (and which he had ignored) a year earlier. Upon boarding the plane, the sensation intensified; once he landed in Denver, he couldnt sleep from vomiting and shitting all night long. His new girlfriend suggested that it might be his appendix, so they took a trip to the emergency room. After a CT scan, the doctor confirmed Sutters girlfriends suspicions, and said they had to remove the appendix-which was two to three times larger than it should have been-immediately.\n\"I woke up unable to walk, or move,\" says Sutter. \"It was the most physically traumatic experience of my life. I spent five days in the hospital-basically our entire vacation-and missed the wedding. The doctor told us that it was in the top five worst appendectomies shed ever seen, and that I could have died if Id waited any longer. I guess Id had a ruptured appendix for about an entire year, and it had ruptured again this past summer.\"\nRecovery took months, though he played shows against his better judgement. Sutters final face-off with The Incessant, that long, dark year of staring his darkest parts in the face, gave him a lot more empathy for the people he used to slam in songs in the past. \"In general, writing about what I was going through made me more of a compassionate kind of person,\" he says. \"I think theres a lot more to uncover within the self than to look outward at whats going on and annoying you around you.\" Another grim laugh. \"I wouldnt want to write a song bashing anyone, besides myself.\"",

If last year's aptly named Turn Into compilation showcased a fuzz-loving artist in flux—chronicling her mission to master bedroom recording—then the rising Oakland star's latest, Everybody Works, is the LP equivalent of mission accomplished. \n\nDuterte is as DIY as ever—writing, recording, playing, and producing every sound beyond a few backing vocals—but she takes us places we never could have imagined, wedding lo-fi rock to hi-fi home orchestration, and weaving evocative autobiographical poetry into energetic punk, electrified folk, and dreamy alt-funk. \n\nWhile there's no obvious politics here, Duterte says witnessing the challenges facing women, people of color, and the queer community lit a fire. And when you reach the end of Everybody Works, \"For Light,\" you'll find a mantra suitable for anyone trying, as Duterte says, \"to find your peace even it it's not perfect.\" As her trusty trumpet blows, she sings: \"I'll be right on time, open blinds for light, won't forget to climb.\"",
