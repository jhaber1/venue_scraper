from underground venues in Chicago's Northwest side, NE-HI made its name on both its live energy and cleverly wrought guitar
anthems. On its second album Offers (Grand Jury), the band takes those basement-forged instincts and refines them, lets its
guitars explore new angles, and focuses its songwriting. The result shows there are a wide range of post-punk possibilities
yet to be explored.\nIt all started at Animal Kingdom, a flash-in-the-pan DIY basement in Chicago's Logan Square. There,
in the summer of2013, three friends from college, Jason Balla (guitar/vocals), Mikey Wells (guitar/vocals) and James Weir
(bass) linked up with drummer Alex Otake to score a buddy's film and decided to start bashing around together as NE-HI. NE-HI's
more ambitious sound and heady arrangements broke away from garage rock's back-to-basic's approach. The band's disparate
influences--Wire's post-punk, Springsteen's everyman anthems, along with echoes of dreamy atmospheres of Dave Roback's Rain
Parade and the jangly buzz of Kiwi pop legends The Clean--began burning through. The band attracted the attention of Dave
Vettraino, who asked NE-HI to record at his Public House Recordings studio for posting on his website. Vettraino would go
on to record the band's debut album. The Chicago Tribune's Greg Kot gave the debut the #4 spot in his2014 year-end list.","external_url":null,"doors_at":"21: 00","venue_city":"Austin","venue_name":"Sidewinder"},{"ends_at":null,"id":29627,"max_price":null,"min_price":null,"performing":["Studded

thrive in the in-between. The Indiana quartet craft hyper-melodic songs, built around power-pop chords, deceptively complex
drum patterns, and rock-anthem sentiments that hide some tellingly dark thoughts. Their full-length debut, Routines, sound
both warmly familiar and jarringly distinctive. A kernel of ache lies at the heart of each verse and chorus: nothing cynical
or pessimistic, just bittersweet and honest. Not knowing the right way to do things, they came up with their own way-a solid
DIY philosophy. \"We had an idea of how we wanted our music to sound, but we didnt always know how to achieve it,\" says
Drew Auscherman, who plays guitars and keyboards, writes and sings. \"There was always some exploring and figuring things
out, so it took some time to get to what we wanted to sound like.\"",

the rising popularity of meditative, folky indie acts in the early2000s, forming a twangy, rootsy folk trio was probably
the least surprising move Derek Fudesco could have made. The former bassist and founding member of the successful indie rock
group Pretty Girls Make Graves picked up an acoustic guitar and formed the Cave Singers following PGMG’s demise in January2007, teaming up with vocalist Pete Quirk and drummer Marty Lund.\nThe Cave Singers released two albums on both Matador and
Jagjaguwar Records. Following these releases, The Cave Singers began work on their fifth album. Rather than working with
a record company, they opted to coordinate the project themselves and financed the recording through a crowdfunding campaign.
The campaign raised116 percent of the group’s goal, and the album, Banshee, was released in February 2016.","external_url":"https: //www.eventbrite.com/e/the-cave-singers-tickets-32274701501","doors_at":"20:00","venue_city":"Austin","venue_name":"Sidewinder"}]
